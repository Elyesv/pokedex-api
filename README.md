# ONLINE POKEDEX
***

This repository contains a online pokedex that use the PokeAPI to show every information about the pokemon and
the QuickChart API to generate a stats graph also for the pokemon. 

## HOW TO USE IT
## WARNING : The website work only on desktop

If you are intending of using my pokedex here is some tips. 

* Wait a few second when you arrive at the website so everything can load. 

You will see on the left a list of the 27 first pokemon and on the right an empty box. 
If you click on one of the card the right box will update and show a lot more information about the pokemon.

On the end of the page you can change the page of the pokedex to see the next 27 pokemon or go back to the previous page.

If you are looking for a specific pokemon there's a searchbar at the end of the website with the name of every pokemon so just type the first letter of his name and it should pop up

You can also click on one of the type box (ex GRASS) and this will show every pokemon with this type.

### Once you got the pokemon you are looking for on the right box 
You can click on his name to see his evolution chain and also all the moves he can learn.

It's my second time building a pokedex so it's not perfect but a lot better than the first one
